          Relative balance qualification
        </h5>
        <p>
          The interest rate bonus a depositor can earn from referrals depends on the balance in the referral’s account in relation to the balance in the referrer’s account. The rate scales down if the referral's balance is lower than the referrer’s balance.
        </p>
      </div>
        
      <div>
        For example, if you have a balance of PHP 500,000 and your referral deposits an amount that is equal to or greater than this amount, you will get the full 0.5% additional interest. If their balance is less, your additional interest rate might reduce to 0.4% or less, depending if they’ve deposited the following:
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 ml-2">
          <li>At least as much as you - 0.5%</li>
          <li>Almost as much as you - 0.4%</li>
          <li>Half as much as you - 0.3%</li>
          <li>Less than half - 0.2%</li>
          <li>1/10th of your savings - 0.1%</li>
        </ul>
