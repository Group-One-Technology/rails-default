# Rails 7 Starter

This repository is an easily-forkable, stripped-back Rails codebase which includes the default gems required for a new rails codebase. It is designed so that it can be picked up and built upon by someone who has never worked with Rails before - there are very little new abstraction required beyond HTML & CSS, and we've intentionally left out things which create additional barriers to beginners such as webpack or npm.
