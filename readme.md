# Rails Starter

This repository is designed to be the absolute simplest way to build web applications. It follows the principles of [HTML first](https://new.tonyennis.com/blog/c4gAsd-ry-what-is-html-first?) and aims to be radically Novice Friendly. This documentation will assume you have basic/beginner knowledge of HTML and CSS, and little-to-no knowledge of Ruby on Rails.

We use Rails for the things that plain HTML can't do - creating routes and templates, communicating with a database, and a few other utilities. But we intentionally don't use many of the "Rails Way" patterns and libraries in places where limited value is offered over a plain HTML approach, and/or where an entirely new set of concepts/patterns needs to be learned.

# What's Included

**Core**

- The gems we find ourselves installing with every new app we build.
- Functionality for identity using Devise.

**Frontend**

- HTML-attribute-based libraries for styling (tailwind), and behaviour (htmx, minijs).
- Tonic.css - a collection of utilities for making things look nice by default (forms, common interface patterns external libraries).
